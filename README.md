# Welcome to the course!

This is the `README` for the introductory group assignment. If you see this `README`, you have already successfully set up your GitHub account and accepted the assignment - hooray! We will dive into this assignment next class - feel free to read ahead but you don't need to do anything yet.

## Preparation

Make sure to complete the Git training first before tackling this assignment. This is a group assignment so everyone will be working on this exact same repository with you. Think before you branch/commit/merge, but also - don't be afraid of making mistakes. If you run into trouble and can't figure out how to fix the problem, see if one of your peers can help you on the class slack. If that doesn't do the trick, let me know what you've tried (but be aware that I may be equally flummoxed). You can do this assignment using GitHub Desktop (i.e. no command line Git is necessary) but if you want to use command line Git you are more than welcome to do so.

## Assignment

1. clone this repository to your computer
1. create a branch off of `main` with a descriptive name (ideally including your initials)
1. work in your branch! not on `main`
1. find the location of the repository folder on your computer
1. open the `project.Rproj` file with *RStudio* (in some operating systems you can just double-click the file), this will launch *RStudio* in your repository
1. open the `template.md` file in *RStudio* and **save it as new file** with your name in it and the file ending `.md` in the same folder, for example `inigo_montoya.md`
1. add image(s) to the `images` folder as described in the instructions for question 3 (in the `template.md` file)
1. commit your changes and push them back to GitHub (don't merge into `main` locally!)
1. go to [Pull requests](/pulls) and create a new pull request to propose a merge of your branch into `base: main` and suggest one of your peers as a reviewer so they get notified
1. make sure to resolve merge conflicts if there are any (the GitHub conflict editor is quite good so you can do this online, see [help here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/addressing-merge-conflicts/resolving-a-merge-conflict-on-github))
1. **DO NOT** merge your pull request until your reviewer has given you the go ahead (reviewers: make sure to react to pull request notifications, take a look over the proposed merge and leave a quick comment like "looks good, ready to merge")
1. once your reviewer has given you the go ahead, complete your merge
1. synchronize back with your desktop and check that the master branch has your updates

Happy branching!
