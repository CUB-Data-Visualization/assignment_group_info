# Welcome to the course!

This is the `README` for the introductory group assignment. If you see this `README`, you have already successfully set up your GitHub account and accepted the assignment - hooray!

## Preparation

You are strongly advised to complete the Git training first before tackling this assignment. This is a group assignment so everyone will be working on this exact same repository with you. Think before executing commands, but also - don't be afraid of making mistakes. If you run into trouble and can't figure out how to fix the problem, see if one of your peers can help you. If that doesn't do the trick, let me know what you've tried (but be aware that I may be equally flummoxed).

## Assignment

1. clone this repository to your Desktop
1. create a branch off of `master` with a descriptive name (ideally including your initials)
1. work in your branch! not on `master`
1. open the [`template.md`](/template.md) file in a text editor of your choice (suggested are [Atom](https://cub-computational-tools.github.io/syllabus/atom/), [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/) or simply [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download), all will do the job) and **save it as new file** with your name in it and the file ending `.md` in the same folder, for example `inigo_montoya.md`
1. add image(s) to the [`images`](/images) folder as described in the instructions for question 3 (in [`template.md`](/template.md))
1. push your changes back to GitHub (don't merge into master locally!)
1. create a new pull request to propose a merge of your branch into `base: master` and suggest one of your peers as a reviewer so they get notified
1. make sure to resolve merge conflicts if there are any (the GitHub conflict editor is quite good so you can do this online, see [help here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/addressing-merge-conflicts/resolving-a-merge-conflict-on-github))
1. **DO NOT** merge your pull request until your reviewer has given you the go ahead (reviewers: make sure to react to pull request notifications, take a look over the proposed merge and leave a quick comment)
1. once your reviewer has given you the go ahead, complete your merge
1. synchronize back with your desktop and check that the master branch has your updates

Happy branching!
