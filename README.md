# Welcome to the course!

This is the `README` for the introductory group assignment. If you see this `README`, you have already successfully set up your GitHub account and accepted the assignment - hooray! We will dive into this assignment next class - feel free to read ahead but you don't need to do anything yet.

## Preparation

Make sure to complete the Git training first before tackling this assignment. This is a group assignment so everyone will be working on this exact same repository with you. Think before you branch/commit/merge, but also - don't be afraid of making mistakes. If you run into trouble and can't figure out how to fix the problem, see if one of your peers can help you on the class slack. If that doesn't do the trick, let me know what you've tried (but be aware that I may be equally flummoxed). You can do this assignment using GitHub Desktop (i.e. no command line Git is necessary) but if you want to use command line Git you are more than welcome to do so.

## Assignment

1. clone this repository to your computer
1. create a branch off of `main` with a descriptive name (ideally including your initials)
1. work in your branch!!! not on `main`
1. find the location of the repository folder on your computer
1. start *Positron* and open your repository folder (not its parent directory, the actual repo folder) with `File` -> `Open Folder` from the menu
1. open the `template.qmd` notebook file in *Positron* and **save it as new file** with your name in it and the file ending `.qmd` in the same folder, for example `inigo_montoya.qmd`
1. complete all the questions in your `.qmd` file, remove the instructions (starting with `>`) and examples as you go, and commit your changes to your branch along the way
1. make sure your `.qmd` notebook file continues to render to `.html`
1. push all your commits back to GitHub (don't merge your branch yet, we'll do that together in the next class!). Note that the `.html` file should not be added to GitHub (and will not be by default)
1. submit the rendered `.html` file on canvas
